**CacheRecipeMetadata** - Fork of [LastRecipeRunResult.py](https://github.com/autopkg/grahampugh-recipes/blob/main/PostProcessors/LastRecipeRunResult.py) to store `etag` and `last-modified` headers from URLDownloader outputs. The intended use is for running AutoPkg in a CI runner/VM where the VM host restores files without extended attributes, which is true for the [Cache action](https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/777). Gitlab's [implementation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/caching/) might not have the same shortcoming.
